# Backend Connection Fixes for MyRecordinSchool

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes applied to the backend PHP files to ensure proper connection and functionality with the two databases: `student_violation_db` and `rfid_system`.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Issues ✅
**File:** `backend/config/database.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Improved database connection management
- Added better error handling and logging
- Added database synchronization helper method
- Enhanced connection testing with actual data counts

**Key Improvements:**
- Added `syncStudentData()` method to automatically sync students between databases
- Improved `testConnections()` to show actual database statistics
- Better error reporting with line numbers and file names
- Proper header management when included from other files

### 2. Authentication Endpoints ✅
**Files:** `backend/auth/login.php` and `backend/auth/register.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Fixed password verification to handle both plain text and hashed passwords
- Added automatic student synchronization between databases during registration
- Improved error handling and response formatting
- Enhanced security with password hashing for new registrations

**Key Improvements:**
- Backward compatibility with existing plain text passwords
- Secure password hashing for new accounts (using `password_hash()`)
- Automatic sync of student data to RFID database for attendance tracking
- Better error messages and JSON response formatting

### 3. Violations Endpoint ✅
**File:** `backend/violations/index.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Optimized database query to avoid unnecessary JOINs
- Improved violation categorization logic
- Enhanced data formatting for mobile app compatibility
- Better handling of students with no violations

**Key Improvements:**
- More comprehensive violation categorization
- Returns complete student information with violations
- Improved error handling and logging
- Better JSON response structure

### 4. Attendance Endpoint ✅
**File:** `backend/attendance/index.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Fixed database mapping between `student_violation_db` and `rfid_system`
- Added support for both `attendance` and `saved_attendance` tables
- Improved time parsing and status determination
- Enhanced error handling for date/time operations

**Key Improvements:**
- Unified query across both attendance tables
- More accurate status determination (EARLY, PRESENT, LATE, VERY_LATE)
- Better time formatting and error handling
- Support for filtering by month and year

### 5. Backend Routing ✅
**File:** `backend/index.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Added API information endpoint at root path
- Improved error handling for 404 routes
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Better CORS and preflight handling

**Key Improvements:**
- Root endpoint now shows available API endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Better 404 responses with available endpoints list
- Enhanced debugging and logging capabilities

### 6. Test Connection Endpoint ✅
**File:** `backend/test_connection.php`

**Problems Fixed:**
- Better header management when included from routing
- Enhanced error reporting
- Improved connection testing

## Database Schema Compatibility

### student_violation_db
```sql
students table:
- id (Primary Key)
- student_id (Unique identifier)
- student_name (Full name)
- year_level (Academic year)
- course (Course/Program)
- section (Class section)
- password (Hashed password)
- added_at (Created timestamp)
- updated_at (Modified timestamp)
```

### rfid_system  
```sql
students table:
- id (Primary Key)
- name (Full name)
- student_number (Maps to student_id from violations DB)
- rfid (RFID tag number)
- image (Profile image path)
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login.php` - Student login with password verification
- `POST /auth/register.php` - Student registration with dual database sync

### Student Management
- `PUT /student/update.php` - Update student information

### Violations
- `GET /violations/{student_id}` - Get student violations with categorization
- `PUT /violations/acknowledge/{violation_id}` - Mark violation as acknowledged

### Attendance
- `GET /attendance/{student_id}?month={month}&year={year}` - Get attendance records

### System
- `GET /test_connection.php` - Test database connections
- `GET /` - API information and available endpoints

## Testing

A comprehensive test file has been created at `backend/test_all_endpoints.php` that:
- Tests all API endpoints
- Validates database connections
- Creates test data and verifies responses
- Provides detailed output for debugging

To run tests:
1. Ensure XAMPP is running with Apache and MySQL
2. Open `http://localhost/backend/test_all_endpoints.php` in browser
3. Review all test results for HTTP 200 status and success responses

## Security Improvements

1. **Password Security:** New registrations use `password_hash()` for secure storage
2. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing plain text passwords still work
3. **SQL Injection Protection:** All queries use prepared statements
4. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting without exposing sensitive data
5. **CORS Security:** Proper CORS headers for mobile app compatibility

## Installation and Usage

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Import `student_violation_db (1).sql` to create violations database
   - Import `rfid_system.sql` to create attendance database

2. **Backend Deployment:**
   - Copy backend folder to XAMPP htdocs directory
   - Ensure file permissions are set correctly

3. **Testing:**
   - Visit `http://localhost/backend/test_connection.php`
   - Run the comprehensive test at `http://localhost/backend/test_all_endpoints.php`

4. **Mobile App Configuration:**
   - Set IP address to your computer's local IP
   - Set port to 80 (or 8080 if using alternative XAMPP setup)
   - Test connection in app settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Connection Refused:**
   - Ensure XAMPP Apache and MySQL services are running
   - Check Windows Firewall settings
   - Verify IP address configuration in mobile app

2. **Database Not Found:**
   - Ensure both databases are created in phpMyAdmin
   - Import the provided SQL files completely
   - Check database names in `config/database.php`

3. **Authentication Failures:**
   - Verify student exists in violations database
   - Check password format (should match student_id for existing records)
   - Test with known working credentials (e.g., student_id: 220342)

4. **Empty Response Arrays:**
   - This is normal for students with no violations/attendance
   - API returns empty arrays with success:true status
   - Test with student_id 220342 which has sample data

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Test Database Connection:**
   ```
   GET http://localhost/backend/test_connection.php
   Expected: success:true with both database connection confirmations
   ```

2. **Test Registration:**
   ```
   POST http://localhost/backend/auth/register.php
   Body: {"student_id":"TEST001","name":"Test User","password":"TEST001","year":"4th Year","course":"BSCS","section":"A"}
   Expected: success:true with student data returned
   ```

3. **Test Login:**
   ```
   POST http://localhost/backend/auth/login.php  
   Body: {"student_id":"TEST001","password":"TEST001"}
   Expected: success:true with authentication confirmed
   ```

4. **Test Data Retrieval:**
   ```
   GET http://localhost/backend/violations/220342
   GET http://localhost/backend/attendance/220342
   Expected: success:true with relevant data arrays
   ```

All endpoints should now work correctly with proper error handling, data synchronization, and mobile app compatibility.
